# Autonomous Robotics - SoSe25 - University of Stuttgart

This repo is created for the coursework (Arduino Projects) of the course **Autonomous Robotics**.

## Lecture 1 (L1)

Task 1: Multiple LEDs: Have a series of 5 LEDs and have them turn on one after the other, left to right
Task 2: Reverse the direction.

## Lecture 2 (L2)

Task 1: Have an LED turn on when a button is pressed. The LED and button should be connected on the breadboard. Repeat the same but the LED should turn  off when a button is pressed.
Task 2: Repeat previous, but this time the button and the LED should not be connected on the breadboard. Read the button by the Arduino, and then control then LED by the Arduino.
