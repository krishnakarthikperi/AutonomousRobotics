This repo is created for the coursework (Arduino Projects) of the course **Autonomous Robotics**.

## Lecture 1 (L1)

Task 1: Multiple LEDs: Have a series of 5 LEDs and have them turn on one after the other, left to right. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hJ8QkMwGQ4i-l1-e1?sharecode=ZooWZIA-ulrS_A3c_1gAO2oXOQa8n0Dvl2nE6Hozyzo)<br/>
Task 2: Reverse the direction. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bI464ocoWES-l1-e2?sharecode=e6RfK87S02WrCVi7zC1SgisBqahaVf68Xb9hgtgvAb8)<br/>

## Lecture 2 (L2)

Task 1: Have an LED turn on when a button is pressed. The LED and button should be connected on the breadboard. Repeat the same but the LED should turn  off when a button is pressed. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ajPgSZU56MF-l2-e1?sharecode=RgMfGx5hiCPHcDj_zhd_OJZI9Fr0bAxvV4WpuuqnhP8)<br/>
Task 2: Repeat previous, but this time the button and the LED should not be connected on the breadboard. Read the button by the Arduino, and then control then LED by the Arduino. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hnib7FmlpS2-l2-e2?sharecode=dn9LQhNcbJ1YYELoTBB9S8Bn8FbzMgPpwA7o9qlBOrA) <br/>

## Lecture 4 (L4)

Task 1: Read using AnalogRead and then display voltage values from your potentiometer on your serial monitor. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5EOeyrrYFJD-l4-e1?sharecode=M3vBqhe5XnSQc5XdXnw9cGKBE4mlKYNn0_nb2eTpyUk)<br/> 
Task 2: Use the potentiometer as a variable resistor (rheostat) to change the brightness of an LED. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1sTSvuVBoZm-l4-e2?sharecode=6T3plzTSAMWlc1Ht7YTPOyNe6qsd61gbp3f1tH9MoPM)<br/>
Task 3: Use the potentiometer as a voltage divider to change the brightness of an LED. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/icCvKBsOocl-l4-e3?sharecode=Ubf5kkhAJhFSgs-qaqCn_yuvXQFYSnWXBejOOC1Yn9s)<br/>
Task 4: Each time you press the button, the number displayed on the 7-segment display increases by 1. The display should return to “0” after “9”. Define each number display as a function. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4PAccsg1uu6-l4-e4?sharecode=CapoOvxodorFzS1dZZ2VJQrauTSGstR067wIkgCp8P8)<br/>
Task 5: Use the potentiometer to display 0-9 on your 7-segment display. As you rotate the potentiometer knob, the display should go from 0 to 9. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5gGIqWsQ5SX-l4-e5?sharecode=XMnYzKcSOReT-5qyNVVjyb1sCQxHd0QnshevsfN3N9g)<br/>

## Lecture 6 (L6)
Task 1: Recreate a traffic light system (2 sets of RYG LEDs). The system is by default green for the cars and red for the pedestrians. When a pedestrian presses a button, the lights change after a while; and reverts back to the default after some specified time. A sound is played for as long as the pedestrian signal is green. [TinkeCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fQc7a6GmkT8-l6-e1?sharecode=LEyYZ-lkkpnBymJxyu3Z0cpqBbyCgg6UwcRkW5zzqrk)
Task 2: Use an RGB LED for the pedestrian signal. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kXappy6Xs52-l6-e2?sharecode=kGg1CQsxhN0q7CDnr1d_ZvqJnVmJ-r5hL_6yeRPlioQ)
Task 3: Use an RGB LED to make it glow in purple, white, orange, etc (TinkerCad)[https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iV5nr1n2Q8U-l6-e3?sharecode=UjqDg25dqTmqDcbUgBkmGSE6PlNp_s8ac_LQCGCpG5U]
Task 4: Use a potentiometer to sweep colours from [0,1,0] to [1,0,0] in RGB. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/26zWguSU4IT-l6-e4?sharecode=jyP4HkH_PsF_LFhRsHZ4Y5RcpWNczzD5UyQbnj2g9uo)
Task 5: Create a circuit with a photoresistor and an LED, so that the LED lights up when it is dark outside. (TinkerCad)[https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3Davgd1QEK2-l6-e5?sharecode=O4kOQMAjRZU8Ny3yp54x34_tb2RBdxz_nFtqjq5Sy0s]
Task 6: Find out the resistance of your photoresistor when it is kept in the dark. (TinkerCad)[https://www.tinkercad.com/things/d3EiTU34cj7-l6-e6?sharecode=WFO1CmR362hwqIdw7fSKIGCKnuQ1oyo5F-ojQTZCqWc]
Task 7: Using a buzzer, photoresistor, and a potentiometer, create a Museum alarm. The alarm should ring when someone gets too close to it. The critical distance at which the alarm rings should be changeable through the potentiostat. (TinkerCad)[https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8BtZlgjC2ex-l6-e7?sharecode=wZuSYGKfdB22nwAV_PBsV_xiHrVZ7FvhT5gLiHLGqU4]

## Lecture 7 (L7)
Task 1: Use a photoresistor and a servo motor to create a “responsive façade”. The servo controls the “blinds” of the façade: when the sun is high, the blinds rotate to block the light, when the sun is down, the blinds open. (TinkerCad)[https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7Jza14MF2xT-l7-e1?sharecode=aoHIWEA9ARgf_DTTCo6eFznIzwj-YIdmBGoafLh5tEQ]
Task 2: Add a potentiometer to the previous build as a manual override. Add a button, which when pressed gives back the control to the photoresistor. (TinkerCad)[https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jejG3j78Np3-l7-e2?sharecode=Bl0B4UseA5KSEqPAnQ5NDjJM10BEbPGiXFXMmvIVeyE]
