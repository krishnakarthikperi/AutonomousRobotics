This repo is created for the coursework (Arduino Projects) of the course **Autonomous Robotics**.

## Lecture 1 (L1)

Task 1: Multiple LEDs: Have a series of 5 LEDs and have them turn on one after the other, left to right. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hJ8QkMwGQ4i-l1-e1?sharecode=ZooWZIA-ulrS_A3c_1gAO2oXOQa8n0Dvl2nE6Hozyzo)<br/>
Task 2: Reverse the direction. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bI464ocoWES-l1-e2?sharecode=e6RfK87S02WrCVi7zC1SgisBqahaVf68Xb9hgtgvAb8)<br/>

## Lecture 2 (L2)

Task 1: Have an LED turn on when a button is pressed. The LED and button should be connected on the breadboard. Repeat the same but the LED should turn  off when a button is pressed. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ajPgSZU56MF-l2-e1?sharecode=RgMfGx5hiCPHcDj_zhd_OJZI9Fr0bAxvV4WpuuqnhP8)<br/>
Task 2: Repeat previous, but this time the button and the LED should not be connected on the breadboard. Read the button by the Arduino, and then control then LED by the Arduino.

## Lecture 4 (L4)

Task 1: Read using AnalogRead and then display voltage values from your potentiometer on your serial monitor. <br/> 
Task 2: Use the potentiometer as a variable resistor (rheostat) to change the brightness of an LED. <br/>
Task 3: Use the potentiometer as a voltage divider to change the brightness of an LED. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/icCvKBsOocl-l4-e3?sharecode=Ubf5kkhAJhFSgs-qaqCn_yuvXQFYSnWXBejOOC1Yn9s)<br/>
Task 4: Each time you press the button, the number displayed on the 7-segment display increases by 1. The display should return to “0” after “9”. Define each number display as a function. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4PAccsg1uu6-l4-e4?sharecode=CapoOvxodorFzS1dZZ2VJQrauTSGstR067wIkgCp8P8)<br/>
Task 5: Use the potentiometer to display 0-9 on your 7-segment display. As you rotate the potentiometer knob, the display should go from 0 to 9. [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5gGIqWsQ5SX-l4-e5?sharecode=XMnYzKcSOReT-5qyNVVjyb1sCQxHd0QnshevsfN3N9g)<br/>
